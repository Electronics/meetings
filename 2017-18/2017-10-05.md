* * Laurie Kirkcaldy
* Apologies

### Conflict on the committee and new meeting structure
* Disseminate information via email and as meeting minutes

### Welcome meeting summary
* VMware issue caused by a bug in the web thingy
* * Can be solved by getting people to install VMWare remote console
* The VMWare server broke and rebooted
* Session went well otherwise, people seemed to have fun
* Lecture theatre was good. Easy access to most of the room was good
* Fixing cslib should have happened later, not during the meeting
* Interacting with new people should have been prioritised over fixing cslib
* * It was difficult to let go of cslib due to the amount of time that had been spent putting it together

### Decide on subject for meeting on 11/10/17

### CTF status
* We said last meeting that it was going to be a thing

### SUCSS challenges
* Make a stash of SUCSS challenges (crypto, web, wireshark)
* Izzy to make some crypto challenges

### Ideas for next week
* Continue with web challenges
* Re-do the challenges we couldn't do last week with the system not breaking
* Have some alternative challenges in parallel
* Don't rely on VMWare
* Call it something like "Web hacking: reinstalled and not broken any more"

### Posters in labs
* Tom to email Jules to get the lab poster updated
* Tom has made some draft session posters (well, memes. Uhh...)

### Any other business

### Date of next Committee
